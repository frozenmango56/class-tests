                    <!--unordered list-->
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reading books. During the summer, I read lots of books that I check out from the library. The genre of books I read is mostly fiction and fantasy.</li>
                        <li>Playing the Piano. I play the piano and take piano lessons through the Masaki School of music.</li>
                        <li>Swimming. I like to go swimming, whether it is in a pool or snorkeling at beaches around the island. While snorkeling I have seen lots of interesting underwater sea life.</li>
                        <li>Hiking. During the summer I go on hikes with my family. I like to walk through the trees and enjoy the scenery.</li>
                        <li>Tubing. Over the summer we usually go to Texas where we visit family. While we are there we usually go tubing at a lake.</li>
                        <li>Bowling. During this summer, my family and I went bowling frequently. I was able to learn how to walk and bowl.</li>
                        <li>I personally enjoy reading and the piano, and the other hobbies give me a chance to spend quality time with my family.</li>
