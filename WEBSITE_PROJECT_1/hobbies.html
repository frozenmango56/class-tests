        <p>Reading  Books
            A hobby that I have is reading books. During the summer, I read lots of books that I check out from the library. The genre of books I read is mostly fiction and fantasy .
             
            Playing the Piano
            Another hobby of mine is that I play the piano. I take piano lessons through the Masaki School of music.
            
            Swimming
            I like to go swimming, whether it is in a pool or snorkeling in beaches around the island. While snorkeling I have seen lots of interesting underwater sea life.
