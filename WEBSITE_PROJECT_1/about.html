        <p>My name is Isaac Haisler and I was born on July 20th, 2009. I was born in Texas but my family and I moved to Hawaii when I was around six months old. I go to Roosevelt High School and have six siblings. I am beginner scuba certified, which qualifies me to dive to 60 feet underwater! Last year I was enrolled in a archery class sponsored by parks and recreation. I won first place in district age group 14-16. During this summer, I got many chances to go bowling with my family  and was able to improve my average score and bowling technique. Before I didn't walk and bowl, I just walked up to the line and then rolled the ball. This year I started learning how to do the four step approach which allows me to bowl faster and better.</p>
